🥴 Import found in a type declaration file failed to resolve. Either this indicates that runtime resolution errors will occur, or (more likely) the types misrepresent the contents of the JavaScript files. https://github.com/arethetypeswrong/arethetypeswrong.github.io/blob/main/docs/problems/InternalResolutionError.md

🎭 Import resolved to a CommonJS type declaration file, but an ESM JavaScript file. https://github.com/arethetypeswrong/arethetypeswrong.github.io/blob/main/docs/problems/FalseCJS.md

💀 Import failed to resolve to type declarations or JavaScript files. https://github.com/arethetypeswrong/arethetypeswrong.github.io/blob/main/docs/problems/NoResolution.md
